Welcome to Transport Data Science.

# Structure of the book {-}

The book's structure corresponds to the module structure for the course Transport Data Science in the Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) at the University of Leeds.
Chapter \@ref(introduction) introduces the book and some reading material that will be useful during the course.

## Software information and conventions {-}

The **knitr**\index{knitr} [@xie2015] and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} [@R-bookdown] packages are used to compile the book.
The majority of the code chunks are in R and Python.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
xfun::session_info()
```

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).

## Acknowledgments {-}

Many thanks to Charles Fox who taught the first 2 years of this course.
